/**
 * `authorizeToolCall()` — the SINGLE authorization decision for every
 * agent tool call (deny-layer spec §6.1).
 *
 * This is the one place that answers "is the agent allowed to run this
 * tool?". The dispatcher switches purely on the `decision` this returns;
 * no other code makes that call. It is pure and unit-testable — it reads
 * the wallet's grant store + approval policy (via the existing
 * `resolveUxTreatment` resolver) and folds them into one of three
 * outcomes:
 *
 *   - `authorized` — the agent already has permission. Writes still show
 *     the 6 s run-down veto (`treatment: "rundown"`); reads run silently
 *     (`treatment: "silent"`).
 *   - `ask`        — no standing permission; the user must make a
 *     deliberate two-step choice (proposal card → approval sheet).
 *   - `deny`       — hard reject. `reason` records why (for `__DEV__`
 *     logs only — the wire reason the agent sees is the fixed
 *     `permission_denied` token, per the user-facing-error rule).
 *
 * The model is the spec's `Scope → {Auto | Ask | Never}` (§4.0):
 *   - `Never` (`always_deny` grant) → `deny`. Deny-overrides-allow is
 *     enforced inside `resolveGrant`.
 *   - `Auto` (permanent/session/timed grant) → `authorized`.
 *   - `Ask` (`always_ask`, or the safe default) → `ask`.
 *   - watch-only wallet → `deny`.
 *   - headless (`interactive === false`) + would-be-`ask` → `deny`
 *     (`approval_unavailable`): fail closed when no human can approve.
