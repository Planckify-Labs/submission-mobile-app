# Fails when "shared" code — components/, hooks/, app/ — branches on a
# chain namespace string literal. The rule: chain-specific knowledge
# lives on the `WalletKitAdapter`, and shared code dispatches through
# `walletKitRegistry` / `services/walletKit/chainInfo.ts` helpers. An
# `if (namespace === "eip155")` in shared code means a new chain will
# silently take the wrong branch — exactly the bug class that broke
# EVM when Solana was added.
#
# Allowlist (below): files where namespace branching is intentional
# (dispatch tables, per-namespace import flows, the chain picker). Each
# entry must carry a one-line reason; reviewers delete entries when the
# underlying code is refactored.
#
# Run via `pnpm check:chains`. Exits 0 on clean, 1 with the offending
# lines otherwise.
