/**
 * Base64 encoding for raw bytes — deliberately NOT `Buffer.prototype
 * .toString("base64")`.
 *
 * Root cause this works around: `@stellar/js-xdr`'s `XdrWriter`
 * allocates via the AMBIENT GLOBAL `Buffer` (not an explicit
 * `import { Buffer } from "buffer"`), and `@stellar/stellar-base`'s
 * `Keypair.sign()` / `Transaction.toXDR()` both call
 * `.toString("base64")` on the result. Whatever `Buffer` resolves to
 * under this app's Hermes runtime does not correctly implement
 * `.toString("base64")` — confirmed empirically: it silently produced
 * a comma-joined decimal byte list (`Array.prototype.toString`'s
 * fallback, which ignores its argument) instead of a base64 string,
 * which broke both transaction submission (Horizon rejected it as
 * `transaction_malformed`) and would have broken SIWS-Stellar auth
 * signatures the same way.
 *
 * `btoa` is a genuine RN/Hermes global (unlike `Buffer`, which this
 * app never polyfills) — same fallback shape already proven for Sui's
 * `bytesToBase64` in `services/chains/sui/SuiAdapter.ts`. Every
 * Stellar call site that needs to base64-encode raw bytes MUST go
 * through this helper instead of `Buffer.prototype.toString("base64")`.
