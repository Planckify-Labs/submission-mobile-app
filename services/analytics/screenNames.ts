// Explicit allowlist, not a passthrough of the raw route: expo-router's
// usePathname() resolves dynamic segments to their real values (e.g. a tx
// hash or purchase id inside "/pay-merchant/receipt/abc123"), which must
// never be sent verbatim. Only the top-level segment is looked up here, and
// only funnel-relevant flows are mapped — auth/onboarding/settings screens
// are deliberately left out (return null → not tracked), same spirit as
// excluding sign-in/sign-up from the event catalog.
